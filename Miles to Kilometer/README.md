# Miles to Kilometer Converter

This Python script uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for converting miles to kilometers.

## How to Use:

1. Run the script.
2. The GUI window will appear with an entry field for inputting miles.
3. Enter the distance in miles you want to convert.
4. Click the "Calculate" button.
5. The equivalent distance in kilometers will be displayed.

## Code Overview:

### Main Program:

- The script creates a Tkinter window with entry fields, labels, and a button for user interaction.
- The `miles_to_km` function is defined to perform the conversion when the "Calculate" button is clicked.
- The `miles_entry` Entry widget allows the user to input the distance in miles.
- Labels (`miles_label`, `is_equal_label`, `kilometer_result_label`, `kilometer_label`) provide context and display the result.
- The `calculate_button` Button widget triggers the conversion when clicked.
