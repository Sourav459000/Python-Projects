# Pomodoro Timer Project

This Pomodoro Timer project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the `tkinter` library in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features:

- **Timer Reset:**
  - The "Reset" button allows you to reset the timer and clear any ongoing sessions.

- **Timer Mechanism:**
  - The timer alternates between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
  - Work sessions last for 25 minutes.
  - Short breaks last for 5 minutes.
  - Long breaks occur every 4 work sessions and last for 20 minutes.

- **Countdown Mechanism:**
  - The countdown mechanism displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
  - Updates the UI dynamically as the timer counts down.

- **UI Setup:**
  - The UI includes a large timer display, a start button, a reset button, and a checkmark display for completed work sessions.

- **Images:**
  - Uses a tomato image as a visual representation of the Pomodoro timer.

## How to Use:

1. Run the script.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
3. The timer will alternate between work sessions and breaks.
4. Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.

## UI Components:

- **Timer Display:**
  - A large label displaying the current timer status (work/break) and time remaining.

- **Tomato Image:**
  - A visual representation of the Pomodoro timer using a tomato image.

- **Start Button:**
  - Initiates the Pomodoro timer.

- **Reset Button:**
