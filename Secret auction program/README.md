# Simple Bidding System

This Python script implements a simple bidding system where users can enter their name and bid for an item. The program continues to collect bids until the user decides to finish the bidding process. After the bidding is completed, the program identifies the winner based on the highest bid.

## Features

- **Bidding System**: Users can enter their name and bid for an item.
- **Winner Identification**: After bidding is finished, the program identifies the bidder with the highest bid as the winner.
- **Clear Screen**: The `replit` library is used to clear the screen for a cleaner user experience.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your name and bid when prompted.
3. Indicate whether there are additional bidders by typing 'yes' or finish the bidding by typing 'no'.
4. Once the bidding is finished, the program will announce the winner.

## Usage

```bash
python bidding_system.py
```

## Requirements

- Python
