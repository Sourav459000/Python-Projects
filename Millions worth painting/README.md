# Millions Worth Painting (Random Dot Painting)

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to create a mesmerizing visual of randomly placed and colored dots. The dots are arranged in a grid pattern, and their colors are randomly selected from a predefined list.

## How to Run:

1. Run the script.
2. A Turtle graphics window will appear.
3. The turtle will paint a grid of dots with random colors.

## Code Overview:

- The script initializes the Turtle graphics environment.
- The color list (`color_list`) contains RGB tuples representing different colors.
- The turtle (`tim`) is set to a fast speed and is moved to the starting position.
- A loop paints a specified number of dots in a grid pattern.
- Each dot is drawn with a random color from the `color_list`.
- The turtle moves forward to create the next dot in the grid.
- After every 10 dots, the turtle moves to the next row in the grid.
